    PyTorch better for task.
    STart in Jupyter Notebook and then use Standalone Python Scripts.
    Most modern GAN papers (e.g., StyleGAN, BigGAN, DeepFill v2) use PyTorch because of its flexibility and dynamic computation graph.
    Top AI labs (OpenAI, Facebook AI, NVIDIA) use PyTorch for GAN-related work.
    PyTorch is generally considered easier for debugging and experimentation due to its dynamic computation graph.
    Meta (Facebook) published a comparison showing that PyTorch often has better performance for custom deep learning tasks:
